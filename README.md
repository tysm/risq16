# risq16

This is a programming language project for MATA77 at UFBA (Funcional Programming). The language was built for the 2019.2 coursework and it's going to be used by the professor as an example in the following semesters.

The instruction set (RISC) was strongly based on MIPS and the language uses 16 registers (r0-r15, where r15 is the stack pointer) with 16 bit each one.

## Installing

It can be installed using the RAcket COmmand-line tool:

```{bash}
raco install risq16/
```

## Example

You can find example codes using this language in `examples`.
