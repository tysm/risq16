# risq16

This is an assembly language project for MATA77 at UFBA (Funcional Programming). The language was built to showcase Racket's ability to create domain specific languages for the 2019.2 coursework and it's going to be used by the professor as an example in the following semesters.

The instruction set is RISC-based and strongly based on MIPS. The language uses 16 registers (r0-r15, where r15 is the stack pointer) with 16 bits each.

## Installing

It can be installed using the RAcket COmmand-line tool:

```{bash}
raco install risq16/
```

## Example

You can find example codes using this language in `examples`.
